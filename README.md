# [SiamRAAN]

## 1. Environment setup
This code has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04, Python 3.6, Pytorch 1.2.0, CUDA 11.0.
Please install related libraries before running this code: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Test
Download the pretrained model:  
[model](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1SwibqDA8kaImvmssDNUprA?pwd=867p) code: 867p  
 and put them into `tools/snapshot` directory.

Download testing datasets and put them into `test_dataset` directory. Jsons of commonly used datasets can be downloaded from [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1js0Qhykqqur7_lNRtle1tA#list/path=%2F) or [Google driver](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TC8obz4TvlbvTRWbS4Cn4VwwJ8tXs2sv?usp=sharing). If you want to test the tracker on a new dataset, please refer to [pysot-toolkit](https://github.com/StrangerZhang/pysot-toolkit) to set test_dataset.

```bash 
python test.py                                \
	--dataset UAV123                      \ # dataset_name
	--snapshot snapshot/general_model.pth  # tracker_name
```
The testing result will be saved in the `results/dataset_name/tracker_name` directory.

## 3. Train

### Prepare training datasets

**Note:** `train_dataset/dataset_name/readme.md` has listed detailed operations about how to generate training datasets.

### Download pretrained backbones
Download pretrained backbones from [google driver](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DuXVWVYIeynAcvt9uxtkuleV6bs6e3T9) or [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1IfZoxZNynPdY2UJ_--ZG2w) (code: 7n7d) and put them into `pretrained_models` directory.

### Train a model
To train the SiamCAR model, run `train.py` with the desired configs:

```bash
cd tools
python train.py
```

## 4. Evaluation
If you want to evaluate the tracker, please put those results into  `results` directory.

```
python eval.py 	                          \
	--tracker_path ./results          \ # result path
	--dataset UAV123                  \ # dataset_name
	--tracker_prefix 'general_model'   # tracker_name
```

## 5. Acknowledgement
The code is implemented based on [pysot](https://github.com/STVIR/pysot). We would like to express our sincere thanks to the contributors.
